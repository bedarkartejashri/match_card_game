# Memory Matching Card

A Memory Matching Card Game is build using Vue.js.
The objective is to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions. Each card is flipped over to reveal its content. If two selected cards match, they remain visible. If they do not match, they are flipped back face down. The game continues until all pairs are matched and the player wins.
